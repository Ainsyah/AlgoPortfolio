Problem scenario : 
The e-commerce business, which is among the most well-known in a busy metropolis, has seen substantial expansion and 
has a number of warehouses that are thoughtfully placed across the city to reduce delivery times. However, as the business grew, 
the logistics of its supply chain complicated, making it challenging to optimise package delivery within the specified time period. 
Due to variables such as distance and traffic, the corporation now confronts difficulty in assuring timely delivery of items from 
numerous warehouses to clients. The logistics organisation must choose the best way to optimise its supply chain logistics in order 
to improve consumer satisfaction, reduce costs, enable scalability, and react to changing conditions. This entails devising a system 
that takes into consideration all important aspects and limits in order to efficiently transport items while accounting for variables 
such as warehouse locations, delivery distances, and traffic conditions. The business hopes to increase performance in delivering items 
on schedule by tackling these optimization difficulties and streamlining its supply chain processes. 

The main goals are to ensure: 
  1. Route Optimization
     Finding the best possible route to deliver packages to all warehouses throughout the city within the given time frame.

  2. Cost Reduction
     Minimising travel distance as short as possible and optimising routes to reduce costs associated with transportation, 
     such as fuel consumption.
